                                <h1 class="brand-heading">Hey</h1>
                                <p class="intro-text">Today is our 1st year anniversary<br> So there are something that I want you to know <br> &hearts;</p>

                            <hr>
                                <p class="intro-text">
<br>When I first met you, it just felt so right                                    
<br>It's kinda hard for me to explain
<br>And I know it's hard for five million reasons to make it real
<br>But I don't think I could wait
<br>I wanna take it slow but it's so hard
<br>Because you’re really tempting me
<br>I think you're perfect even with your flaws
<br>If you ask what I like about you 
<br>the answer is I LOVE IT ALL
<br>I’ll give my all just for you
<br>Because you're all I'm dreaming off
<br>Nothing else, I need you to do
<br>You should know that 
<br>I feel so good inside when i’m with you
<br>
<br>I like you a lot
<br>You’re my favorite everything	
<br>And right next to you is my favorite position
<br>When you look at me, 
<br>I don’t know how to resist	
<br>You make me buzz like an astronaut
<br>I won't ever let go
<br>Because you pulled me like a magnet
<br>And now I'm right where I belong
<br>
<br>I'm so addicted to you like a drug and no cure can fix it	
<br>If I'm broken down and I'm bruised
<br>I don't care about much else
<br>I'm gonna get myself back home to you
<br>And no matter what I do, all I want is you	
<br>Everytime when I'm with you, I just get that feeling inside
<br>And when I see you, I can't take you out of my mind
<br>Every kiss every touch
<br>Makes my heart feel so nice
<br>I got mad love for you
<br>I would never leave you on your own
<br>I just want you to know that
<br>I like it when you call me baby 
<br>I finally realize what love is.
<br>I so madly deep in love	
<br>
<br>I so f*cking miss you
<br>I don’t want nobody but you
<br>When you are not around
<br>I hope you know that
<br>Not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind	
<br>Every night, I close my eyes and picture us together
<br>
<br>I feel so damn lucky to have you on my arm
<br>Your love is more than worth its weight in gold
<br>I really wanna love you well
<br>I really wanna treat you right
<br>You're everything that makes my world complete
<br>You're the only one that really knows me always 
<br>I want you to know how much you really mean to me
<br>I love you like no other because this has never felt so right
<br>You got me falling deep inside of you
<br>Our love is like wine
<br>It gonna gets better with time
<br>
<br>Today, I just wanna hold you in my arms and whisper in your ear 
<br>
<br>“I love you”
<br>
